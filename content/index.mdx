title: Developer Handbook
---
# Purpose‌

This handbook is designed to be used as a reference guide for common development patterns for Cratebind.

It includes things like examples of frontend components, best backend practices and tips / tricks for dev ops and deployment.

# How To Use

‌This guide is intended to be a resource to answer questions like:

* What's the best way to set up a GitLab CI config?
* How should I build a map component with markers?
* How do I clone a remote database?

# Contributing‌

All Cratebind developers are encouraged to contribute to this guide.

Whenever you solve an issue that you think other people are likely to encounter, it's likely a great case to add that issue to this handbook (especially if it's Cratebind specific).‌

Whenever possible, try to put an emphasis on examples and explanations rather than pasting snippets of code with little to no information. This will make it easier for someone to search and find it later.
